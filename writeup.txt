I pledge my honor that I have abided by the Stevens Honor System.

1) Use the toutines you have impolemented to find the natural cubic pline and interpolating polynomial for the data.

Spline: aj + bj(x-xj) + cj(x-xj)^2 + dj(x-xj)^3
using j=3
	
	S3(x) = 59 - .6804(x-3) -.4804(x-3)^2 + .0107(x-3)^3

Interpolating Polynomial: F0,0 + SUM Fi,i * MULT(x-xj)
Based on the program I created all F's are 0...
	
	Pn(x) = 58 + 0(x-1) + 0(x-2) + 0(x-3) +...+ 0(x-12)
					

2)Compare results by plotting both interpolants and the original data
	Created in 'punProject.m', they look extremely similar to the graph of the data.
	
3)Which interpolant seems to give more reasonable values between the given data points?
	Spline makes much more sense to me. The values that are used in the creating of the spline actually make sense, unlike the Newton values (all 0's). They are negative when the data decreases and are positive when it increases. The spline is also more 'curvy' tham the newton, which to me means that it is closer to the natural data.
	
4) Handwritten.
